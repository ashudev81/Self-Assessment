# Self-Assessment
## Project : Machine Learning Models to predict Covid-19 Mortality:

## Cohesive written analysis: 
    We have selected Machine Learning to predict Covid-19 mortality. Initially we have started working with two different datasets of Covid-19 mortality related to pre-existing health conditions. I have worked on second datasets by cleaning the dataset with removing empty data, cleaning unrelated data, removing some columns which do not provide information for data analysis.   Prepare the charts which show the correlation with Covid mortality with respect to patient pre-health condition, age. We have prepared the postgreSQL database from the normalized covid mortality database to use in future development.

    Initially we have started with a large dataset and when analyzing the dataset into a model, it consumes almost 100% of computer resources and is not even able to complete analysis within a normal time frame. We have normalized the dataset and are able to minimize the issue.

## Cohesive written summary: 

    We have discussed the different points during the project progress for any difficulties we have faced. We have added different age groups in the dataset normalization to get co-relationship between age groups with Covid-19 mortality. 

* We share the details of difficulties with the team regularly and meet on the zoom meeting frequently to discuss the issue if any. 

* Future we would like to concentrate on presentation and preparing live website which provide the result based on the current personâ€™s health condition.

* Team has very high technical skill and quick enough to overcome difficulties experienced. 
### We have used following model in this project:
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosted Classifier
* Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier
* Support Vector Machine
* Deep Learning
